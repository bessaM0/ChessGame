# Chess Game Project

## Project Description

This project aims to create a fully functional Chess game that can be played both in the command line and with a graphical user interface. It will also include features such as artificial intelligence for playing against the computer, a login system for tracking statistics, and multiplayer capabilities.

## Tech Stack
- **Java**: For the main game logic and GUI development.
- **Maven**: For project management and dependencies.
- **Spring Boot**: For backend development.
- **JavaFX**: For GUI development.
- **SQLite**: For storing user statistics and game data.

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Game Logic
- Implementation of all chess rules.
- Command line interface for user interaction.

### Stage 2: AI Opponent
- Implementation of a simple AI opponent.
- Improve the game logic based on testing with the AI opponent.

### Stage 3: Spring Boot Backend and Database Integration
- Implementation of Spring Boot for backend operations.
- Integration with a SQLite/MySQL database to track user statistics.
- Users will be able to save their games and load them later.

### Stage 4: Graphical User Interface
- Transition from a command line interface to a GUI.
- Utilize JavaFX or a web-based framework such as React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.js for GUI development.

### Stage 5: Login System 
- Implementation of a login system for users.

### Stage 6: Multiplayer Capabilities
- Implementation of multiplayer capabilities, allowing users to play against each other in real time.
